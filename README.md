# lp

Questions:

* How to choose the right garbage collection stagegy ?
* Using buddy system or slub is necessary in garbage collection ?
* What time is better to do garbage collection ?
* Is only the current and ancestors' stack frames the root set ?
* What the best way to write the variable from outer scope ?
* Should if-else statements have their lexical scope ?

Please give me any advice or answer, thank you.

```shell
$ ./main
